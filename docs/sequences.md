We have collected three types of sequences, for calibration, quick testing and actual evaluation of algorithms.

## Calibration sequences

- calibration_static.bag
- calibration_dynamic.bag

Both calibration sequences are captured in the same room, illustrated in the figure below:

## Warm-up sequences

We propose two short sequences for researches wanting to have a quick glance at the sensor data and the generic outlook of the environment captured in our dataset:

- warm-up_small-room.bag
- warm-up_large-room.bag

The large room is shown in the following figure:

## Evaluation sequences

These sequences are the ones used in the actual evaluation of algorithms. We propose four variants:

- full-basement-easy.bag
- full-basement-medium.bag
- full-basement-difficult.bag
- full-basement-extreme.bag
