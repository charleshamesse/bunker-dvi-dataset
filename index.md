## About 
This site presents the dataset collected for our ongoing research on portable 3D mapping systems based on depth cameras. Targeting resource and time-constrained mapping operations (e.g. in the context of search-and-rescue), our sequences we include agressive motion, sequences with people moving in the field of view of the sensors as well as sequences with abrupt lighting changes.

Our sensor platform has an extensive set of sensors:
- 3D LiDAR
- Active stereo camera
- Passive stereo camera
- Time-of-flight camera
- Multiple Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)

With this selection of sensors, our dataset allows the comparison of various depth sensing modalities for the task of 3D reconstruction in a challenging, large-scale environment. This environment aims to resemble a typical search-and-rescue operation site and is captured in a large, 1600m<sup>2</sup> area made of small corridors, rooms of all sizes and shapes and various objects.
